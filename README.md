# IBM AI Engineer Certificate - Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks completed as part of the **IBM AI Engineer Professional Certificate**. These labs cover a wide range of machine learning topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, using industry-standard libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 🚀 Repository Content

The labs are organized into several key areas of machine learning:

### 📈 Regression
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Predicting CO2 emissions based on engine size.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Using multiple features to predict fuel consumption and emissions.
- **Regression Trees**: Implementing decision trees for regression tasks (e.g., taxi tip prediction).

### 🔍 Classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifying data points based on their neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: Building models for decision-making tasks (e.g., drug prediction).
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., customer churn).
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finding the optimal hyperplane for classification.
- **Random Forests & XGBoost**: Utilizing ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: A specialized lab focusing on imbalanced datasets using Decision Trees and SVM.

### 🧩 Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting customers based on their behavior and demographics.
